## Project Description
Users review Products. These products could be identified by a link to the website where they are listed. A review consists of a star-rating and some text. Users can also "follow" other users whose reviews they find valuable. A user can then list products for a given category by average rating, or the average rating of only the users they follow. A user can also list the users whose ratings are the most "similar" to their own using the Jaccard distance (google it!). Product reviews can also be ranked according to the similarity score of the people who reviewed them. Users can also list the most followed users. The degree of separation (see Kevin Bacon!) according to the "follow" link can also be displayed next to each reviewer (the assumption is that the "closer" a user is to you, the more trustworthy he/she should be to you).

## Milestone Objectives
### Milestone 3

 - [X] Make all dropdowns persist after they have been used
 - [X] Add an external link to the actual product page for any product on in the service
 - [X] Unify the styling of the site
